# SVG Mapper (Electron)

Minimal Electron + React + TypeScript skeleton for an image-based polygon editor and SVG exporter.

Run (after installing deps):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Features:
- Load an image
- Draw polygons aligned to image pixels (SVG export preserves pixel coordinates)
- Export embedded SVG with image + polygons

This is a starter scaffold — extend it to support editing, undo/redo, seat overlays, and Power BI readiness.
