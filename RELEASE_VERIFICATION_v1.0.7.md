Release: v1.0.7
Repository: https://github.com/TALASSX/SVGMapper
Release URL: https://github.com/TALASSX/SVGMapper/releases/tag/v1.0.7

Verified artifacts (local verification performed):

- File: artifacts_download/SVGMapper.Installer.msi
  - SHA256: 91DCD3CFEA2F642C5B7016966E6D1C3F5763D17215B41D5E49E86CA306BCE421
  - Authenticode signature: signed with self-signed certificate (CN=Sai Teja Talasila), timestamped
  - Windows Defender quick scan: completed on 2025-12-30 20:53:48 (no detections found)

Verification steps performed locally:

1. Computed SHA256 and matched expected value from `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Checked Authenticode signature (`Get-AuthenticodeSignature`) — file is unsigned.
3. Ran Windows Defender quick scan (`Start-MpScan -ScanType Quick`) — no detections returned.

Notes and recommendations:

- Because the MSI is unsigned, exercise caution before installing on production machines.
- Recommended additional checks before installing:
  - Upload the MSI to VirusTotal and review results.
  - Run the installer inside a VM or sandbox first.
  - Scan the file with your AV prior to opening.
